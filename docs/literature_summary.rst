Key Points of the paper:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    


* none of the following claims of Tishby (:cite:`Tishby`) holds in the general case:   
 
    #. deep networks undergo two distinct phases consisting of an initial fitting phase and a subsequent compression phase
    #. the compression phase is causally related to the excellent generalization performance of deep networks
    #. the compression phase occurs due to the diffusion-like behavior of stochastic gradient descent

|

* the osberved compression is different based on the activation function: double-sided saturating nonlinearities like tanh
  yield a compression phase, but linear activation functions and single-sided saturating nonlinearities like ReLU do not.

|

* there is no evident causal connection between compression and generalization.

|

* the compression phase, when it exists, does not arise from stochasticity in training.

|

* when an input domain consists of a subset of task-relevant and task-irrelevant information, the task-irrelevant information compress
  although the overall information about the input may monotonically increase with training time. This compression happens concurrently 
  with the fitting process rather than during a subsequent compression period.
